# RiverShift scientific tools

RiverShift is a separate NISAR GCOV processing engine. Its authenticated UI/API and owner-scoped job records live in moshiour0/SARGuardian_Dynamic; this folder contains only the isolated scientific processing worker in moshiour0/SARGuardian-backend.

## Development scope
This folder provides a first local scientific workflow:
1. Discover NISAR GCOV products in ASF DAAC.
2. Download an exact selected HDF5 granule.
3. Inspect its native diagonal covariance terms.
4. Export one consistently selected AOI-clipped gamma0 layer per acquisition.
5. Screen flood-period new water coverage.
6. Screen persistent erosion/deposition candidates.
7. Validate a binary water mask against an independently prepared reference raster.
8. Measure signed bankline displacement along independently digitised transects.
9. Audit whether at least three compatible GCOV dates cover the AOI sufficiently using the standalone catalogue-feasibility utility.
10. Export an observed-date water time series for discrete, evidence-preserving dashboard playback.
11. Optionally compare a NISAR binary water mask with Copernicus Sentinel-2 L2A SCL and MNDWI water screens.

The separate GitHub Actions worker in `process_gcov_job.py` runs the selected AOI/date request through catalogue review, exact-product downloads, HDF5 validation, raster extraction, flood and persistent-change screening, observed-date playback and private result storage. It uses the AOI and date window supplied by the signed job request; no country-specific study polygon is substituted. RiverShift is geographically reusable across eligible river reaches within the NISAR L-band global land-observation footprint.

The current live request accepts one valid, single-ring WGS84 Polygon AOI of up to **1,000 km²** and a date window of up to **366 days**. It requires at least **four distinct compatible acquisition dates** and at least **90% catalogue-footprint coverage** of the AOI per selected date. The worker then verifies orbit/frame, maturity, frequency/covariance term, HDF5 layer availability and valid raster support, selecting up to **twelve actual dates** and at most **four same-date granules per date**. These are real acquisition dates, not daily measurements. A location/date window with insufficient compatible NISAR observations returns an explicit no-result explanation rather than a simulated layer. The Jamuna–Chowhali AOI is a demonstration case, not a fixed engine target.

See [NASA_SPACE_APPS_2026_JUDGE_BRIEF.md](NASA_SPACE_APPS_2026_JUDGE_BRIEF.md) for the concise global scope, operating envelope and judge reading order.

See `docs/RIVERSHIFT_PROCESSING_SETUP.md` for the GitHub and backend settings required before live job dispatch can run. The optional independent-source comparison is documented in `README_11_validate_with_sentinel2.md`; it is not part of the default worker run.

## Private Google Drive result storage
Configure only the existing parent folder through the GitHub Actions secret `GOOGLE_DRIVE_PARENT_FOLDER_ID`. The worker automatically creates the fixed `RiverShift` folder directly beneath that parent when it is first needed, and reuses that same folder on subsequent runs. Each job is isolated in a UUID-named child folder beneath `RiverShift`; its manifest and output hierarchy remain inside that job folder. The configured parent must already exist and be accessible to the authenticated storage account; the worker cannot create a child folder if the parent itself returns `notFound`.

## Environment
- Python 3.13, as pinned by environment.yml.
- GDAL 3.13.0 or newer with HDF5 support.
- Rasterio compatible with the installed GDAL runtime.
- Earthdata Login/ASF access for product downloads.
- A projected metric output CRS; NISAR GCOV is normally provided in UTM for its footprint.

Install Python dependencies from this folder:

    python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

GDAL is a native system dependency. Install and verify it independently:

    gdalinfo --version

The inspection script refuses GDAL versions older than 3.13.0 because the NISAR HDF5 structure uses CF conventions supported by recent GDAL releases.

## Bankline transect measurement
For signed bankline movement, supply two dated banklines and user-oriented transects as standard WGS84 GeoJSON. The tool reprojects those inputs into the declared projected metre `--analysis-crs` before measuring. Each transect must intersect each bankline exactly once; ambiguous braided-channel intersections are rejected. The sign convention is start-to-end along the transect and must be declared in `--positive-direction-label`.

See `README_08_measure_bankline_migration.md` and `river_shift/README_06_transects.md` before running it.

### GCOV time-series feasibility audit
Run `audit_gcov_acquisitions.py` against the NASA CMR UMM-G 1.6.7 catalogue manifest for standalone catalogue-feasibility review. This utility defaults to **three** eligible dates (configurable with `--minimum-dates`) and **90%** per-date AOI footprint coverage, while matching maturity, direction, relative orbit, frame, bandwidth, polarization, processing type, observation source, CRID, orbit accuracy, frame coverage and center. The authenticated live RiverShift API/worker applies a stricter **four distinct acquisition-date** requirement and separately verifies compatible orbit/frame groups, HDF5 layers and valid raster support before processing. Catalogue coverage alone is not proof of usable pixels.

The GitHub Actions workflow `.github/workflows/river-shift-gcov-audit.yml` runs public catalogue discovery and footprint feasibility without downloading imagery. It is launched manually with the user-selected AOI/date window. The processing workflow `.github/workflows/river-shift-gcov-process.yml` runs only after an authenticated user submits a RiverShift job.

The archived catalogue-feasibility manifest is product-level evidence only: catalogue footprint intersection is not valid raster coverage and does not establish native HDF5 layer compatibility. In the authenticated live processing workflow, the worker downloads the selected exact GCOV granules, verifies the native HDF5 layers and valid raster support, and stops if those checks fail. The exporter requires the exact-granule `.download.json` receipt, checks product maturity and source host, and binds each output COG to its source receipt with SHA-256 before analysis.

## Data-comparability gate
Before pixel-wise comparison, verify:
- Same NISAR instrument/frequency and acquisition mode.
- Same diagonal covariance term and compatible polarimetric configuration.
- Same maturity (do not mix BETA and PROVISIONAL).
- Compatible orbit direction, relative orbit/track, frame and viewing geometry.
- Same CRS, dimensions and affine transform after reprojection/resampling.
- Dates correspond to a documented hydrological event and recovery condition.

A failed comparability check means stop and reselect/reproject the data. Do not force a pixel-wise overlay.

## Core formulas
For GCOV linear gamma0 power:
    gamma0_dB = 10 * log10(gamma0_power)

For newly water-covered area:
    new_water = water_during AND NOT water_before

For persistent erosion candidate:
    erosion = land_before AND water_post_1 AND water_post_2

For persistent deposition candidate:
    deposition = water_before AND land_post_1 AND land_post_2

The erosion and deposition terms are candidate indicators. They do not establish flood causality or legal/field-confirmed land loss.

For independently digitised banklines and oriented transects:
    signed_displacement_m = after_chainage_m - before_chainage_m
    mean_net_rate_m_per_year = signed_displacement_m / (elapsed_days / 365.25)

Each transect must intersect each bankline exactly once. The transect start-to-end orientation determines the sign; ambiguous intersections are invalid.

## Overlap QA and scientific validation design

The live worker now adds a full-resolution `outputs/qa/candidate_overlap_audit.json` report. It compares the erosion, deposition and new-water masks only on their shared valid support, and stops publication if erosion and deposition overlap on that support. New-water may overlap a morphology class because the candidate classes use different date comparisons.

For same-date multi-granule mosaics, the exporter records pairwise valid overlap and gamma0 backscatter differences in the mosaic metadata sidecar. These statistics are diagnostic; they do not use a universal dB acceptance threshold and do not replace source/geolocation review.

The job result summary also carries the full-resolution pairwise candidate intersections and the projected preview-geometry intersection metrics. The RiverShift Results Explorer shows both side by side so a user can distinguish source-mask overlap from overlap introduced by display generalisation.

See [SCIENTIFIC_VALIDATION_AND_OVERLAY_QA.md](docs/SCIENTIFIC_VALIDATION_AND_OVERLAY_QA.md) for the complete independent-reference protocol, class definitions, QA gates, release states, future char/channel candidates and overlay contract. The display preview is intentionally lower resolution: use the full-resolution masks for all area, overlap and validation measurements.

## Reproducibility and provenance
Every JSON result should retain:
- Mission and product.
- Exact granule names and checksums (download manifest).
- Per-date AOI footprint coverage and the compatibility-group signature.
- Observation dates.
- Maturity, frequency and polarization term.
- AOI.
- Input units and threshold method/value.
- Grid/CRS assumptions.
- Software versions.
- Validation status and warnings.

Do not display sample values as measurements. The RiverShift dashboard may display checksum-verified private worker outputs as PROVISIONAL evidence, with warnings that the result is not independently validated. It must not label those outputs VERIFIED. User-imported reports/GeoJSON remain subject to the separate human-review gate: VERIFIED release status, complete provenance, reviewer identity/time, evidence reference and verification-record checksum. Live worker previews are drawn only after the private artifact receipt and report-linked SHA-256 checks pass.

## Test suite
From this folder:

    python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    python -m pip install pytest
    python -m pytest -q

The tests use small synthetic rasters. They verify contracts and algorithms, not real-world model accuracy. Real scientific validation must use independent observations over the selected study area.
